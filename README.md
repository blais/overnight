# overnight: Earnings Trading Assistant

This code fetches lists of symbols with AMC and BMO earnings, fetches data from
TD to assess tradeability of each name and pre-calculate candidate strikes for a
very wide strangle strategy based on the magnitude of the expected move.

The purpose of this output is not automation, but rather to save time when
adjusting existing positions, or to place dedicated earnings trades.
